### Start development server with:

`yarn start` or `npm run start`

It's possible to use a different port by specifying this first like so:

`CVA_PORT=7788 yarn start` to start with port 7788. Same for npm just include `CVA_PORT=7788` at the beginning.

### Build for production

`yarn build` or `npm run build`

### Ways you may add to this

- Add jsx and react - Or just use create react app instead!
- Add a .env for project specific environment values
